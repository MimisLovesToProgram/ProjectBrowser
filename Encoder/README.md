Encoder Documentation
Introduction
The Encoder is a command-line utility that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files securely. Whether you want to protect sensitive documents or explore custom encryption, this tool offers an easy-to-use solution. This documentation will guide you through its features and usage.

Features:
User-Friendly Interface: The Encoder offers a straightforward command-line interface, making encryption and decryption accessible for all users.

Text File Support: Encoder can encrypt and decrypt text files, making it suitable for documents, notes, and more.

Advanced Settings: For users seeking more control, the tool provides advanced settings to customize encryption actions.

Error Handling: Robust error handling prevents data loss and file corruption, ensuring the integrity of your files.

Reversible Encryption: The tool facilitates easy decryption, allowing you to revert files to their original state.

Usage Instructions:
1. Choosing the File
Start by specifying the file you want to encrypt or decrypt using Encoder. Enter the filename, and remember to include the appropriate file extension (e.g., .txt for text files).

2. Selecting the Action
Choose the desired action for the file: encryption or decryption. Ensure that your input matches either "encrypt" or "decrypt."

3. Advanced Settings
If you want to customize the process further:

Enable advanced settings by typing "y."
Specify whether you are working with a file other than text (e.g., binary files) by typing "y."
Decide how many times you'd like to repeat the action (useful for multiple encryptions/decryptions).
4. File Processing
The Encoder will perform the specified action while ensuring that the file remains intact and uncorrupted.

5. Results
The result can be found in the file you chose to encrypt. The tool saves the encrypted or decrypted files for your convenience.

Limitations and Constraints:
Encoder primarily supports English text and common punctuation characters (except backticks).
It can only operate on files within the directory where Encoder is located.
While it may work with various file types, it's optimized for text files.
Excessive encryption can lead to file corruption; the tool sets reasonable limits to prevent this.
