INSTRUCTIONS:

- To choose what file to encrypt/decrypt using this model, write the file's name on the first prompt. !!!IMPORTANT!!!: After each file name
  , append the respective file extension (.txt for text files [most common], and for whatever else you would like to encrypt, just look it  
  up)
- To choose what action to do with this file, write 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' on the second prompt.
- If you trigger the Advanced settings, you will be asked questions about stuff having to do with the file.
- If you would like to check out how it works, try it with the 'Test' text file on this folder.

NOTES:

- This encoding model only supports English and punctuation characters of any kind (except `).
- This model can only perform actions on files existing on the directory the model is located at. For external actions, you can bring the
  files you would like to encrypt/decrypt to this folder, and them send them wherever you want.
- Most likely to work with text files, not applications, though there may be exceptions. But why would you want to encrypt an app anyway?
- Encrypting is undone by decrypting, and trying to encrypt a files many times requires the file to be decrypted that many times as well.
  Decrypting before encrypting though, will (most likely) corrupt the file, even after encrypting it to undo that action.
- You can't encrypt a file too many times, or it will be corrupted. The amount depends on the size of the file, its contents, and perhaps its
  file type / format. The program does not allow you to do so.

HOW TO RUN THE ENCODER:

- Type 'run', and the project's index, and follow the instructions given above.
- Ignore EVERYTHING that has not been mentioned in this guide.
