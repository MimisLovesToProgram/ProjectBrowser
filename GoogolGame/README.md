The Googol Game is a classic number guessing challenge that puts your intuition to the test. In this game, you must attempt to select the greatest number from a list ranging from 1 to 99,999. While progressing through the list, your goal is to decide whether the current number you're presented with is the greatest one.

- You are given a set number of hidden numbers to choose from.
- Your task is to identify the greatest number from this set of hidden numbers, ranging from 1 to 99,999.

1. Begin the game by specifying how many hidden numbers you'd like to generate.
2. The game will then randomly select the hidden numbers.

4. After viewing each number, you decide whether it's the greatest number or not.
5. If you decide to continue, the next number is presented.
6. The game continues until you choose to stop.
7. Once you're done, the game will announce the results.

**Game Results:**

- If the greatest number is among your selections, you win the game, and this achievement is recorded in the game log.
