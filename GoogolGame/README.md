The classic game of Googol, in which you have to (randomly) try to pick the greatest number on a list ranging from 1 to 99,999 (not a googol here).
- While checking through the list, you must use your intuition to decide whether the number you are being given is the greatest one on the list.
- Once you pass a number, and you later realize that one could be the greatest one, you can't go back and pick that one.
- When you feel you have the right number, don't type yes when asked to move on. The game's results will then be announced, and written in the project's result file.
You get to choose the number of items inside this list.
