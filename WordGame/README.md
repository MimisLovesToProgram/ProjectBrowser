A game in which you have to find a word with a random number of letters, in a number of attempts you choose via the difficulty you select.
When you find a letter in the correct spot, it will appear between the underscores hiding the word.
If you find a letter at the wrong spot, it will appear in the "To be placed" list.
Letters that don't exist in the word are shown in the "Used" list.
Find the word before you run out of tries to win!
This project does not have a result file.
