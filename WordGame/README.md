**Word Guessing Game**

**Introduction:**

The Word Guessing Game is a fun and challenging word puzzle that requires you to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. Your 
goal is to uncover the word.

**Game Setup**:

**Difficulty Levels:** You can choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, or Hard. Each level offers a different number of attempts to 
guess the word.

Easy Mode (15 attempts)
Normal Mode (10 attempts)
Hard Mode (5 attempts)

**Select a Difficulty:** Start the game by selecting the difficulty level you prefer.

**Game Rules:**

The game will choose a random word from a dictionary, which you need to guess.

The word is converted to lowercase, and spaces are removed.

At the beginning of the game, the word is displayed as underscores ('_') to represent the hidden letters.

You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word.

**Game Flow:**

For each round, the game provides the following information:

The current state of the word with underscores and revealed letters.
The number of attempts remaining.
A list of letters to be placed in the word.
A list of used letters that are not in the word.
You enter your guess, which should be a word with the same length as the hidden word.

The game checks if your guess is correct:

If your guess is the actual word, you win and are informed of the number of attempts it took to find the word.
If your guess is not the word, the game reveals correct letters and updates the "To be placed" list with letters that exist in the word but are in the wrong place.
Incorrect letters that do not exist in the word are added to the "Used" list.
The game continues until you either guess the word or run out of attempts.

**Game Over:**

Once the game ends, the correct word is revealed.
Note: The game does not generate a result file. Enjoy playing and have fun guessing the hidden word!
