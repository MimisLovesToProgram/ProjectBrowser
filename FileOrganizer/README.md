A customizable and user-friendly file organizer. How to use it:
- Provide all folders from your user's folder, until you get to the folder you wish to organize. Files within this folder will be 
  organized, according to the settings provided.
- Files can be organized by extension (file type), or by a naming segment you can set. If a folder for specific file types already exists on
  your user's base folder, such files will be organized there.
- If there is no (default) folder for the files to be organized already, you will be asked to name one. If there is, you will be asked to name
  another one, within the default one.
This project has no result file, and note that this is the Windows version of the FileOrganizer.
