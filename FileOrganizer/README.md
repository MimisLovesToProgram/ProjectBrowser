File Organizer - A User-Friendly Windows File Organizer

This script is designed to help you organize files within a specific folder on a Windows system. It provides flexibility by allowing you to 
organize files based on either their file extensions or a common naming segment within the file names.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. Provide the path to the target folder that you want to organize. You will be prompted to specify the folders within your user directory that 
lead to the target folder.

2. Choose how you want to organize the files:

    a. **Organize by Extension:** If you choose this option, the script will categorize files based on their file types (e.g., images, text, 
    audio, video). Files with common extensions will be moved to appropriate default folders or custom folders you specify.

    b. **Organize by Naming Segment:** If you select this option, you can specify a common segment found in the file names, and the script will 
    organize the files into folders based on this segment.

3. If there are no default folders for the selected file type or naming segment, you will be prompted to create a new folder where the 
organized files will be moved.

**Note:** If a folder for the selected file type or naming segment already exists within your user's base directory, the script will create a 
subfolder within the existing folder.

*Example:*

- Organizing by extension: If you choose to organize by extension and specify the segment "jpg," all files with the ".jpg" extension will be 
moved to the default or custom folder you specify (e.g., "Pictures").

- Organizing by naming segment: If you choose to organize by a naming segment and specify the segment "work," files with "work" in their names 
will be moved to a default or custom folder you specify.

Please note that this is the Windows version of the File Organizer script and does not generate a result file.

Enjoy your organized files!
