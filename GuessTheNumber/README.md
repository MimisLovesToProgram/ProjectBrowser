First, input a number, and then try to guess the computer's number. You have 3 tries.
If you find the number, you will get the remaining amount of guesses +1 as points.
Then, the computer will randomly guess numbers, and make it's number range smaller according to what information is given by the guess.
After each guess, you are given a hint about whether the number you gave is bigger or smaller than the other number.
First to get 5 points wins. If however both players get to 5 points or above, either the person with most points wins, or it is a draw.
After each game, the results are saved on the GameLog.log file.
