Guess the Number - A Two-Player Number Guessing Game

**Introduction:**

Guess the Number is a classic two-player number guessing game where you'll try to outsmart your opponent by finding their chosen numbers before 
they find yours. This turn-based game adds an element of strategy to your number guessing skills.

**Game Rules:**

1. Player 1 (the computer) and Player 2 (you) each choose a number between 1 and 16.
2. You have three attempts to guess Player 1's chosen number, and Player 1 will make random guesses to find your number.
3. If you guess correctly, you earn points based on the number of attempts remaining.
4. Player 1 adjusts its guesses based on your hints (smaller or larger), gradually narrowing down the range.
5. The first player to accumulate 5 points wins the game.

**Gameplay:**

- As Player 2, you start by choosing a number within the specified range.
- Guess Player 1's number within your limited attempts, getting hints about whether your guess is smaller or larger.
- Player 1, the computer, makes guesses based on a refined range and updates the range based on your hints.
- The game continues until one player reaches 5 points or until it's a draw if both players reach 5 points or more.

**Scoring:**

- If Player 2 correctly guesses Player 1's number, they earn points equal to the remaining attempts.
- The game's results are recorded in the GameLog.log file, indicating which player won or if it's a draw.

**Game Logging:**

After each game, the results are saved in the "GameLog.log" file, indicating the winner and the number of rounds played.

This is a competitive number guessing game that tests your intuition and strategy. Challenge your friends or the computer and see who can reach 
5 points first!
