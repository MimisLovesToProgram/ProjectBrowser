A simple self-improvement app in which you can create multiple goals, update your progress in them, or read random quotes.
Here is how to use it: (for every info on your goals, check the result file)
- Pick one of the options in the first prompt. Here are the options:
  1) You first provide a title for a goal. If the goal is inexistent, it will be created. Otherwise, the existing one will be restarted with a
     new minute goal. Useful when you complete a goal, and you would like to start it over again, maybe to reach your goals faster that time!
     When you create a goal, a timer also starts, to measure how long it took you to complete a goal. When restarting a goal, besides changing
     the goal's minute count and target, this timer is reset.

  2) You provide a goal title. The goal's minute count with this title will be updated to the already existing count, plus the amount of
     minutes you have worked on your goal until the time of updating the count. If the final count meets or exceeds the minute goal under that
     title, you will be congratulated for completing the goal. If the goal's completion time is smaller than the previous one for that goal,
     the Speed Record (measured in days) of the goal will be updated to that time of completion. By choosing this option, you can also add notes
     for that goal, if you would like to. If you would like to clear your notes, just ask to add some, and type nothing. When writting them, and
     you have added as many as you want, you can just type nothing, and the notes you had written will be added. You can only add notes or
     update your existing count at once. By the way, when writting notes, the old ones are replaced.

  3) As long as you want to, you can keep reading quotes from the internet.

If you would like to check on your progress in every goal, you can check the result file of this project.
If you would like to reset all info for all goals, just empty the result file.
