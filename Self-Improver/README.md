**Self-Improver: A Simple Self-Improvement App**

**Introduction:**

Self-Improver is an app designed to help you set and track your goals, update your progress, and gain motivation through inspirational quotes. 
This guide explains how to use the app effectively.

**Getting Started:**

**Initial Information**: When you first run the program, it displays the contents of the project's result file. This information provides 
details about your existing goal titles and their related data, making it easier for you to use the program without checking the result
file manually.

**Goal Management**: Self-Improver offers three main options:

*Set a New Goal or Restart an Existing One (Option 1)*: To create a new goal or restart an existing one, you'll need to provide a title and 
specify the goal's duration in minutes. This feature is useful when you want to achieve a goal repeatedly.

*Update Your Current Progress and Add Notes (Option 2)*: By entering the title of an existing goal, you can update its minute count. If the 
updated count meets or exceeds the minute goal, you'll receive congratulations for completing the goal. Additionally, you can add or update 
notes for that specific goal. Remember that when adding notes, any existing notes will be replaced.

*See Some Quotes (Option 3)*: Enjoy a dose of motivation by reading inspirational quotes. You can keep requesting more quotes as long as you 
like.

**Result File:**

You can always check your goal progress and related information by referring to the result file generated by the program. The result file 
contains details on your goals, progress, and notes.

**Clearing All Info:**

If you wish to reset all information for all goals, you can simply empty the result file.

Self-Improver is designed to help you set, manage, and achieve your personal goals while keeping you motivated. Enjoy your self-improvement journey!
