**Tic Tac Toe Ultimate - A Console-Based Tic Tac Toe Game**

This project is a console-based Tic Tac Toe Ultimate game that allows you to play against the computer. The game board consists of nine Tic Tac 
Toe boards, and the objective is to win on the larger board by winning three smaller Tic Tac Toe boards in a row.

*Usage Instructions:*

- Run the project just like any other. You'll be prompted to enter the number of future moves the computer should calculate. Enter a positive 
  integer to determine the computer's level of difficulty.

- Choose 'X' or 'O' for the player to play with. The computer will take the other symbol.

- The game consists of two players, the user and the computer. The player with 'X' plays first. To make a move, follow these steps:

  a. Enter the Tic Tac Toe's index (1-9) to select the board.

  b. Enter one of its squares' indexes (1-9) to place your symbol.

  Visualization of the squares' numbers above for the Tic Tac Toes:

  [ 1 | 2 | 3 ]
  [ 4 | 5 | 6 ]
  [ 7 | 8 | 9 ]

- The computer will then make its move based on calculated advantages.

- The game continues until it's over.

*Note:*

- The computer calculates its moves based on the specified depth, representing the number of future moves it considers. Higher depths result in a 
more challenging opponent, and a greater move picking time.

*Example:*

- If you choose to play with 'X,' the computer will play with 'O.' The game board consists of nine smaller Tic Tac Toe boards, and each player 
takes turns selecting a board and placing their symbol in one of its squares.

Enjoy your Tic Tac Toe Ultimate game!
