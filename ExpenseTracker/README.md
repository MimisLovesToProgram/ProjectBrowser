Expense Tracker Program Documentation

Introduction:
Welcome to the Expense Tracker program, a tool designed to help you gain insights into your spending habits and create effective budgets. This 
documentation will guide you through the program's key features and how to use them.

Getting Started:

Start by launching the program, and you will be presented with three main actions to choose from: "Log an Expense," "Search for an Expense," 
and "Analyze Current Expenses and Create Budgets."
Log an Expense:

This feature allows you to record your expenses. Follow these steps:
When prompted, provide details about the expense, such as the item or service, the amount spent, and the date.
If the item is new and hasn't been logged before, you will be asked to categorize it.
If the category is new, you can mark it as "important" or "normal." "Important" categories receive a higher portion of your income by default.
Search for an Expense:

Use this feature to search for specific expenses by providing relevant keywords or information. The program will display the first matching 
expense found.
Analyze Current Expenses and Create Budgets:

This feature helps you manage your budget by analyzing your financial situation. Here's how it works:
Enter your monthly income and monthly debt payments.
Indicate whether you have a savings goal or a major expense you're saving for.
If your debt payments exceed 43% of your income, the program will allocate an additional 30% of your income for savings to help with debt 
payments.
If you have a savings goal, the program will allocate an extra 20% of your income to help you achieve your goal.
If your savings need to be increased, the program will first reduce allocations to "normal" categories and then "important" categories if 
necessary.
The program will provide budget recommendations for each expense category. These budgets are calculated as an average of the estimated budget 
(based on income allocation), your set budget, and your previous month's expenses in that category.
You can adjust the way your income is split among categories and change the budgets for specific categories according to your preferences.
AutomatedAnalysisData.txt:

Please note that the "AutomatedAnalysisData.txt" file located in the program's folder is used for internal data management and should not be 
directly modified by users.
Data Accuracy:

As you log more expenses, the program's data analysis and budgeting recommendations will become increasingly accurate, helping you make 
informed financial decisions.
That's it! The Expense Tracker program is designed to help you gain control over your finances, and we hope you find it useful in managing your expenses and creating budgets effectively.
