**Password Strength Checker - Assess Password Security**

**Introduction:**

The Password Strength Checker evaluates the security of a given password. It employs a set of rules to assess the strength of the password based on common security criteria.

**Usage:**

1. Input the password you want to check.
2. The tool calculates the password's strength and provides a percentage rating, with 0% being very weak and 100% being exceptionally strong.

**Strength Criteria:**

The tool evaluates password strength based on the following criteria:

- Length: Longer passwords receive a higher score.
- Special Characters: The presence of special characters (e.g., !@#$%) improves the score.
- Uppercase Letters: The inclusion of uppercase letters enhances the score.
- Numbers: Having numbers in the password increases its strength.
- Avoiding Dictionary Words: The tool checks if the password contains common dictionary words, reducing its strength.

**Strength Ratings:**

- Below 20%: Very weak.
- 20% to 40%: Quite weak, but acceptable.
- 40% to 60%: Good.
- 60% to 80%: Very strong.
- 80% to 100%: Exceptionally strong.

**Notes:**

- A score of 100% indicates that the password cannot be further strengthened.
- This tool does not create a result file; it provides an immediate strength assessment.

The Password Strength Checker helps you ensure the security of your passwords by assessing their strength according to industry best practices.
