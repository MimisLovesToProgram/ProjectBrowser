**Word Race Game**

**Game Overview:**

The Word Race Game is a challenging word game where you are given a limited time to type as many words as possible that start with a specific letter. Your goal is to maximize the number of valid words you can enter within the time limit.

**High Scores:**

The game keeps track of your high scores for different difficulty levels (easy, normal, and hard). These high scores are recorded in the result 
file.

**Game Setup:**

You can select one of the following difficulty levels:

Easy: 60 seconds time limit.
Normal: 40 seconds time limit.
Hard: 20 seconds time limit.
You'll be provided with the starting letter for the words you need to type.

**Gameplay:**

The game will start when you indicate that you're ready.
You need to type words that start with the given letter within the time limit.
Each correctly typed word increases your score.
If you run out of time before typing a word or type an incorrect word, you'll be informed.
The game will show your total score when the time is up.
High Score Tracking:

After completing the game, your score will be compared to your previous high scores for the selected difficulty level.
If your new score is higher than the previous high score, it will be updated in the result file ("record.txt").
Result File:

The result file keeps a record of your high scores for each difficulty level.
If you ever reset the result file, it will be populated with new high scores the next time you play the game.
