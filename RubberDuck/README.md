A duck responding to what you tell it randomly. The only thing it understands is whether what you tell it is a question, an exclamation, a simple sentence or not.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This duck is able to make you smile within a minute via the fact that it's responses defy all logic most of the time. In other words, it is what you need for a good laugh!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can also save your conversations for you to be able to laugh at them later on, at the 'saved.txt' file (the result file)!

HOW TO USE:
- Say "bye" in a short sentence to end the conversation
- Say "save" in a short sentence to save the conversation
- Say anything else to simply talk. Get different responses by adding ! or asking something instead of just saying normal stuff.
