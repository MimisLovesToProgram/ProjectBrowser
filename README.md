Hi there! In this project, you can browse a collection of smaller and bigger projects with a wide variety of themes, made originally by me.
This is just a short guide about what you need to know to be able to navigate in this project:
- If you need to know what a project you are browsing is, type "help", and the project's index shown when browsing. E.g.: help 1
- If you want to stop browsing, type "exit".
- If you want to try a project out, type "run", and the project's index. E.g.: run 5. This will also clear the screen before running.
- If you want to clear the screen, type "clear". This will also show all projects available to browse, once the screen has been cleared.
- If you want to check the projects available to see, without deleting the current history, type "show".
- If the project's results are stored in a file, type "results", and the project's index. E.g.: results 7
- If you opened this guide from the command line or file manager, you can open it from the browser as well by typing just "help".
That's all you need to know. Have fun browsing!
