**Password Generator - Create Strong and Readable Passwords**

**Introduction:**

The Password Generator is a tool designed to create robust and human-readable passwords. It uses a combination of random elements and 
dictionary words to produce hard-to-crack passwords. The generated passwords can be stored in a log file for your convenience.

**Features:**

- Generates easily readable and complex passwords.
- Utilizes a dictionary of combined words (e.g. accome) for word-based password elements.
- Supports creating multiple passwords at once.

**Usage:**

1. Specify the number of passwords you want to generate.
2. The generator combines dictionary words, punctuation, and numbers following a specific pattern to create each password.
3. The generated passwords are written to a log file for future use.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose you need 5 strong and human-readable passwords. Simply input "5" when prompted.

**Password Storage:**

The generated passwords are stored in the "PassLog.log" file, allowing you to keep the ones you like. For added security, you can further 
encrypt the passwords using the Encoder tool available in the Project Browser.

This tool ensures you have secure passwords at your disposal.
