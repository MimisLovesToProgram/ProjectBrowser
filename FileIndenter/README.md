**Introduction:**

The FileIndenter is a small project designed to modify the indentation of a given text file. It allows users to specify the current indentation 
level and the desired final indentation level. The project processes the input file, adjusts the indentation of each line accordingly, and then 
saves the modified content back to the original file.

**How to Use:**

- Run the script and select any type of text file when prompted.
- Enter the current indentation level of the file.
- Specify the desired final indentation level.
- The project adjusts the indentation of each line in the file accordingly.
- The modified content is then saved back to the original file.

**Important Considerations:**

- The project assumes that the input file has consistent indentation throughout. If it does not, the project will ignore spaces that don't match
  the indentation level given.
- It is essential to provide valid numeric inputs for the current and final indentation levels to achieve the desired result.

*Note:* Ensure to back up your file before using this project, as indentation adjustments might alter the file's structure.
